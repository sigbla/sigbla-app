# Sigbla docs

This folder contains the markdown files for the Sigbla documentation.

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) to generate the html, and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
as the theme.

## Building the docs

Use python3, and install mkdocs-material, if needed, with

`pip install mkdocs-material`

If Python3 isn't your default, try

`python3 -m pip install mkdocs-material`

Then simply build and serve the docs locally with

`mkdocs serve`
